/**
 * Yen's K-shortest path algorithm
 * (Yen, Jin Y. (Jul 1971). "Finding the k Shortest Loopless Paths in a Network". Management Science. 17 (11): 712â€“716. doi:10.1287/mnsc.17.11.712)

 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Yen's K-shortest path algorithm does not allow for cycles which makes it suitable for path choice. It is however costly
 * to run, especially without any additional constraints on these paths and using Dijkstra for all intermediate path searches.
 * However, it is easy to understand and a good benchmark implementation for other more sophisticated approaches.
