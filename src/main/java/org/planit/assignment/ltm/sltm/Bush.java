/**
 * A bush is an acyclic directed graph comprising of all implicit paths used by an origin to reach all its destinations. This is achieved by having the total origin demand at its
 * root vertex which is then split across the graph by (bush specific) splitting rates that reside on each edge. The sum of the edge splitting rates originating from a vertex must
 * always sum to 1.
 * <p>
 * The vertices in the bush represent link segments in the physical network, whereas each edge represents a turn from one link to another. This way each splitting rate uniquely
 * relates to a single turn and all outgoing edges of a vertex represent all turns of a node's incoming link
